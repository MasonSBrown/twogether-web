# Twogether — Landing page

This folder contains a Next.js landing page component for the Twogether marketing site.

Quick start:

1. cd into the web folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `pnpm install`
3. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`

The page lives at `pages/index.tsx`. It's a mobile-first, responsive marketing page with placeholder images and an email waitlist form (no backend hookup).

Notes:
- The design uses a small CSS module at `styles/landing.module.css` and inline SVGs for icons.
- Replace placeholder behavior (email join) with your preferred API endpoint.
